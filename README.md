## About Unit Testing
This project applies essential Unit Testing practices including:

- Writing clear and simple unit tests

- Following the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
  
-  Using assertions to verify outcomes

-  Managing setup and cleanup for tests

-  Testing for expected exceptions

-  Creating data-driven test cases

-  Isolating tests by mocking dependencies
